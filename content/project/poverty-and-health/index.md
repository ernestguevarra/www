Research in this area is undertaken in collaboration with the [Young Lives](https://www.younglives.org.uk) project, a prospective study of the dynamics of childhood poverty in four countries (Peru, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and India).  Projects include investigations of nutrition, healthcare, health behaviours and self-rated health in relation to characteristics of poverty.
